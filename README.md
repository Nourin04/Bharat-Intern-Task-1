#Iris Flower Classification - Deep Learning Project
This project implements a deep learning model for classifying Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and is trained on the well-known Iris flower dataset, which contains 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

##Features
###1.Dataset: The Iris dataset, consisting of 150 samples with four features and three class labels.
###2.Model: A neural network with fully connected layers, trained to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its features.
###3.Training: The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and an optimizer like Adam.
###4.Evaluation: The accuracy of the model is evaluated on a test set, and performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix are provided.
